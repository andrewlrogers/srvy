# SRVY
##A Physical Likert Questionnaire for Non-Profits
===
---

##Overview / Functionality
SRVY uses a screen to pose a visitor a question and then records their response using four physical buttons that correspond to four different values (Strongly Like, Like, Dislike, Strongly Dislike). The response is recorded in a SQLite3 database. On a daily basis SRVY generates a series of charts and reports which are automatically uploaded to a Dropbox application. Questions can be appended on a daily basis by editing a .CSV file also located in the Dropbox account.

The intended audience is smaller art non-profits such as museums, theaters, and community art centers. The goal is to provide a low-cost and customizable tool that will allow organizations to track audience engagement and determine metrics of success with little daily upkeep.
